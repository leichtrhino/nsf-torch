# nsf-torch

This is an unofficial implementation of [neural source-filter model][^1] proposed by Wang et al.
The model takes sequences of fundamental frequency also called F0 and sequences of context vectors which appears in the WaveNet model.

### Requirments

* PyTorch
* LibROSA (optional: if you run train.py)
* Kaldi (optional: if you train.py and the test script for evaluation)

### Usage

### TODO

* documentation
* make it a library (if it is combinient)
